##  What is the structure of a scientific paper?

The number and the headings of sections may vary among journals.

* Title
* Abstract
* Introduction
* Methods
* Results
* Discussion
* Acknowledgments
* Literature cited

### Discussing each section

* TITLE 
  -
  * The title will help you to determine if an article is **interesting or relevant** for your project.
  * **Well-written titles** give a reasonably complete **description of the study** that was conducted, and sometimes even foreshadow the **findings**. Included in a title are 
    1. The **species studied**
    2. The **kinds of experiments** performed
    3. A brief indication of the **results obtained**

* ABSTRACT
  -
  * Abstracts provide you with a complete, but very succinct **summary** of the paper.

  * An abstract contains
    1. brief statements of the purpose 
    2. methods 
    3. results
    4. conclusions of a study
 
  * Abstracts are often included in article databases, and are usually **free** to a large audience. Thus, they may be the **most widely read portions** of scientific papers.


* INTRODUCTION
  -

  * You will find **background** information and a statement of the **author's hypothesis** in the introduction.

  * An introduction usually describes 
    1. the theoretical background, indicates 
    2. why the work is important, 
    3. states a specific research question, and 
    4. poses a specific hypothesis to be tested.


* METHODS
  -
  * The methods section will help you determine **exactly how** the authors performed the **experiment**.
  * The methods describes both 
    1. specific techniques 
    2. overall experimental strategy
 
  * Generally, the methods section does **not need** to be read in detail. Refer to this section if you have a specific **question about the experimental design**.


* RESULTS
  -
  * The results section contains the **data** collected during experimentation.

  * The results section is the **heart** of a scientific paper. 
  * In this section, much of the important information may be in the form of **tables** or **graphs**. 
  * When reading this section, **do not readily accept an author's statements** about the results. Rather, carefully analyze the raw data in tables and figures to **draw your own conclusions**.


* DISCUSSION
  -
  * The discussion section will explain the **authors interpret** their data and how they **connect** it to other work.

  * Authors often use the discussion to describe what their **work suggests** and how it **relates to other studies**. 

  * In this section, authors can anticipate and address any **possible objections** to their work. The discussion section is also a place where authors can **suggest areas of improvement for future research**.


* ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
  -
  * The acknowledgments tell you what people or institutions (in addition to the authors) **contributed** to the work.

  * In reading the acknowledgments, you can see what sources provided **financial support** for the study. You might want to know an **industry** group or the federal **government** funded the study.

* LITERATURE CITED
  -
  * This section provides the sources cited throughout the paper.
  * This section offers information on the range of other studies cited: 
    1. Does the author cite **only his** or her previous studies? 
    2. Are both **classic** and **modern** sources influencing this work? 
    3. Does the author look to the work of scientists in **other disciplines**? 
    4. The literature cited section is also helpful for generating a list of **background reading** on the topic under study.
